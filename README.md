This project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT API into a Spring Boot application to create intelligent, dynamic, 
and conversational backend systems. By leveraging Spring Boot’s powerful framework and ChatGPT’s advanced language model,
this project enables the creation of chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems that interact naturally with users.
